Sobr blocks you from making transactions whilst you are too drunk, tired or otherwise impaired, through giving you a variety of challenges you have to complete to try and evaluate your current state.

These challenges included:

 - Having to submit a photo of your pupils to make sure their size was within a standard range
 - Solving a bluetooth rubiks cube in under a minute
 - Having under 0.45s reaction time to a colour changing on the screen
 - Talking to GPT and convincing it you are who you say you are, by indirectly answering the security questions until it is happy, and having it evaluate your messages to try and estimate your current state.
